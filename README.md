# Bangladesh Digital Transformation Simulation (2025-2035)

This project provides a comprehensive simulation framework for modeling Bangladesh's digital transformation ecosystem from 2025-2035. It includes modules for various digital dimensions like infrastructure, governance, economy, skills, cybersecurity, and more, allowing for scenario analysis.

## Structure

- `simulation.py`: Main simulation controller. Orchestrates the model execution and analysis.
- `data_handler.py`: Placeholder for data loading and preprocessing logic (requires implementation).
- `analysis_engine.py`: Performs basic analysis, generates placeholder metrics, creates simple visualizations, and produces an HTML report.
- Component Models (`digital_*.py`): Individual modules modeling different facets of the digital transformation (Infrastructure, Government, Economy, Skills, Cybersecurity, Inclusion, Emerging Tech, Innovation, Sectoral, Policy, Society, International Integration). These contain placeholder logic and illustrative synthetic data.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies.
- `reports/`: Directory where HTML reports are saved.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/deluair/BD_digital_transformation_simulation.git
    cd BD_digital_transformation_simulation
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You might need to install Plotly's dependencies for displaying figures in certain environments if not using the HTML report)*

## Running the Simulation

To run the default baseline scenario:

```bash
python simulation.py
```

This will execute the simulation from 2025 to 2035 using the placeholder logic and synthetic data defined in the models.

You can modify `simulation.py` to run different scenarios (e.g., by uncommenting the "pro_investment" scenario code block) or change simulation parameters.

## Output

Running the simulation produces:

1.  **Console Output:** Logs indicating the initialization and execution steps for each model and year.
2.  **HTML Report:** A report file named `simulation_report_<scenario_name>.html` (e.g., `simulation_report_baseline.html`) is generated in the `reports/` directory. This report includes:
    *   A summary table of the final year's state for key metrics.
    *   Embedded Plotly visualizations showing the evolution of the composite maturity index and selected key indicators.

## Further Development

This framework is a starting point. Significant development is required to make it a realistic simulation tool:

-   **Implement Data Loading:** Populate `data_handler.py` to load real data from Bangladeshi sources.
-   **Refine Initial Conditions:** Use loaded data to set accurate starting points for 2025.
-   **Develop Simulation Logic:** Replace placeholder logic in each `digital_*.py` model with sophisticated algorithms (System Dynamics, ABM, ML etc.) reflecting the complex interactions.
-   **Enhance Analysis:** Implement robust calculation of maturity indices and detailed analysis in `analysis_engine.py`.
-   **Expand Visualization:** Create the comprehensive dashboards outlined in the initial prompt.
-   **Validate Model:** Compare simulation outputs against real-world data and expert knowledge.
